*Yup, that's the back of my neck.*

Last weekend [Dietrich](http://twitter.com/#!/dietrich), [Matteo](http://twitter.com/#!/ZER0) and I were fortunate enough to be able to tack a trip to Berlin on to the end of out trip to Merry Old London to attend [JSConf.eu](http://jsconf.eu). I've been to many conferences ( and even helped produce a few? ) and was totally impressed by JSConf, on a number of levels:

* __Room for rockstars *and* local speakers__ ( some speakers of course fall into both groups ). The main room at JSConf was very large, to the extent that it would freak me out doing a talk there. It was good to see that the upstairs room was both cozier and the talks more diverse than the main room.
* __Levity!__ The conference opened with a charming girl named Mandy [singing Brendan Eich a hilarious song](http://vimeo.com/29873668). Mid-afternoon on day 1 there was a coding competition where the loser for each question had to drink booze mixed by robots.
* __Proper caffeination__ thanks to [Espresso Ambulanz](http://www.espresso-ambulanz.de/), a key success factor for the North Americans fighting off both jet lag and the ill effects of the party the night before.
* __Fantastic illustrations__. I wasn't able to get all of them, [but here are a few](http://www.flickr.com/photos/anisotropic/tags/amazinillustration/).

The weekend for me was a mixture of attending talks, talking to people about Firefox, demoing [mobile nightly builds](http://nightly.mozilla.org/), helping [Olle](http://twitter.com/#!/olleolleolle) install a Nightly build on *his* Galaxy S, and fielding all sorts of SDK questions from how to use Websockets, to AMO review queue gripes. That doesn't necessarily sound like loads of fun, but it *was*, and it was a great reminder of how awesome community-driven events like this can be.

The single greatest moment for me happened during [Christian Heillmann's talk](http://www.wait-till-i.com/2011/10/05/jsconf-eu-community-js-reloaded-how-to-rock-as-a-movement/) on Sunday where right at the end, he showed the packed house some demos of [upcoming features in Firefox's dev tools](http://cf.cdn.vid.ly/8e6x9g/webm.webm). I'm not exaggerating when I say that people were *blown away*. The crowd reaction was huge!
