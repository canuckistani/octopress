This past week Mozilla released <a href="http://goo.gl/eo861">Firefox 5</a> as promised ( and not without some <a href="http://goo.gl/Ein9w">controversy</a> ). Personally I think it's exciting to see Mozilla deliver on mobile and desktop in this rapid release cycle. There is <a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/">a lot happening</a> in web tech right now and it is great to see Google and Mozilla quickly implement new standards ( and even proposals! ) to get them into the hands of web developers, addons developers and end users. 

Along with Firefox 5, Mozilla released a  1.0 of the new <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/developers/builder">Addons SDK</a> ( formerly known as Jetpack ) as well as a Beta for the web-based <a href="https://builder.addons.mozilla.org/">Addon Builder</a>. These new tools for Addons developers bring with them a new and very different way for developers to create Addons using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, including a straightforward and well-documented <a href="http://goo.gl/jHt9o">JavaScript API</a>.

If you are not yet familiar with how the SDK works, I've put together a screencast to introduce some of the current feature set:

<iframe width="560" height="349" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/G2GVkorqRq0?hd=1" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<em style="font-size: 75%;">Note: for best viewing head on over to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDQ8LOZGWO8">Youtube</a> and be sure to watch the video at 720p, otherwise the text on the screen may not be easily readable.</em>

In the first part of the video I introduce the SDK itself and demonstrate how to create, run and test your addons using the 'cfx' command-line tool. Once we get the basics out of the way, I spend some time walking through a very simple, working extension I wrote using the SDK.

If you're interested in digging into Addons development using the SDK here are some additional resources:

<li><a href="https://github.com/canuckistani/Goo.gl-Jetpack-extension">The Github repo for my Url Shortener extension.</a></li>
<li>Fred Wenzels's much more feature-ful <a href="https://github.com/fwenzel/copy-shorturl">Copy ShortUrl</a> extension, also based on the Addons SDK.</li>
<li>Discussion generally happens on the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/mozilla-labs-jetpack?hl=en">Jetpack Google Group / mailing list</a> as well as in #jetpack on <a href="irc://irc.mozilla.org">irc://irc.mozilla.org</a></li>
