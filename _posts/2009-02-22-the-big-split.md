<p>I recently ran across <a href="http://bciconcoclast.blogspot.com/2009/02/looking-at-85-ridings.html">some nice data</a> on how BC voting form the last election would look like with the new riding boundaries that will be used in this year's election. If you munge the data a bit ( with a few lines of Python included in the attached zip file ) you get some interesting conclusions IMO about the effect of vote splitting on who gets to form the government in BC:</p><br/>
<pre>
Vote-split ridings: 15
Close call ridings ( within 3% ): 5
Normal results: Lib: 48, NDP: 37
Split vote results: Lib: 33, NDP: 52
Swing results: Lib: 28, NDP: 57 ( votes swings +3 % )
</pre>
<p>The obvious read of this data I am sure most people notice is that, if all non-liberal votes went to the NDP instead of being split with the Greens, the NDP would cruise to an easy victory under the current first-past-the-post system. It is the existence of the Green vote that the Liberals gleefully exploit to maintain a hold on power. It also assumes falsely that this majority of voters who vote for non-Liberal candidates actually all agree on who should run the province, or that they would all be satisfied with an NDP regime.</p>
<p>This is clearly not true, as people continue to vote Green despite no real hope under the current system for a significant number of Green MLAs. I tend to think of Green votes as protest votes by people against our current political system in a very specific way. I think Green voters are saying that the Environment and Climate Change are important issues and that neither a pro-business nor a pro-labor party is adequately convincing in the attempts to tackle this issue.</p>
<p>My own interest in looking at ridings where NDP / Green vote-splitting shifts the balance of power, but instead to look at how 15 ridings in BC are, at best, <em>mis-represented</em> by Liberal MLAs when in fact the majority of voters in those ridings voted for <em>someone else</em>.</p>
<p>Apologists for the current electoral system might say that a Liberal MLA is the best representative for the riding because more people voted Liberal than for any other single party ( for example ). Given the current system, that seems like a reasonable compromise, one that also leans our legislature in favor of majorities, and therefore more stable governments.</p>
<p>Where I disagree with this is that this all assumes we can't do better. We <em>can,</em> in fact, and a lot of people in BC have thought long and hard on <a href="http://www.bc-stv.ca/">a better way to run our electoral system</a> to prevent. If <a href="http://stvforbc.com/">the STV referendum passes</a> we may very well see this in action in 2013.</p>
<p>According to my quick analysis, here's a list of ridings the NDP shuld concentrate on based on this data alone ( and not recent polling, which might be more instructive as to where they stand ). Based on my data at least, these ridings hold the balance of power:</p>
<pre>
Split ridings:
Saanich South
Burnaby-Lougheed
Kootenay East
Stikine
Oak Bay-Gordon Head
Comox Valley
Vancouver-Fraserview
Port Moody-Coquitlam
Boundary-Similkameen
Burnaby-Deer Lake
North Vancouver-Lonsdale
Vancouver-Point Grey
Vancouver-False Creek
Saanich North and the Islands
West Vancouver-Sea to Sky

Ridings within 3%:
Surrey-Tynehead
Surrey-Panorama
Penticton
