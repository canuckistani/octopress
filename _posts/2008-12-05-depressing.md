<p>That's what the last couple of weeks in Canadian Politics has been for me. Basically, every single person involved did quite likely the *wrong* thing:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Harper, filling the financial update with partisan poison pills, grossly underestimating how the opposition would react.</li>

  <li>Dion, not immediately stepping down, not realizing that Canadians' dislike for the coalition concept rests hugely on the prospect of Dion as PM.</li>

  <li>The GG, for allowing Harper to prorogue ( although I can hardly blame her )</li>

  <li>Bob Rae and Michael Ignatieff, for not immediately flipping a coin, burying the hatchet and moving on with one of them installed as leader, the other as deputy.</li>
</ul>
<p>My advice of the last two is to get *ON* that shit, tout suite, and maybe the coalition might be salvageable. Even better, if those two worked together during an election in March, they might even win.</p>
<p>My advice to the coalition members when faced with the prospect of an election is: start NOW, and co-operate, and figure out how to compete in BC, suburban southern Ontario and Montreal. Specifically, I think the Liberals should bow out of strategic ridings in the lower mainland and Vancouver Island that are currently Conservative seats largely guide to vote splitting. I might even crunch some numbers and figure out which ones those are...</p>
