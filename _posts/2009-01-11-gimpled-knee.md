<p>On Friday morning I was most of the way down the block walking to the bus stop when I slipped on a patch of what looked like wet concrete and fell. Amongst other things, my right leg went out at an awkward angle and I felt my knee joint pop out oh-so-briefly and then back in again. Oh, the PAIN; I almost passed out from it. The lucky thing was I was not that far from home, so I got back up, called Sandie, and tried to figure out if I could walk.<br /></p>
<p>Friday was largely wasted hopping a cab to the hospital with Sandie ( oh my huggably cute Malaysian Florence Nightingale! ), waiting in the ER, getting X-Rayed, cabbing home, watching TV and generally being very uncomfortable. I was hugely concerned right after the fall that a) I had seriously screwed something up in my knee, and also that b) I was in shock and therefore not a great judge of how bad it was. All I could think was, 'dislocated knee joint, torn ligaments, no more Yoga!'.</p>
<p>Luckily the X-ray showed nothing broken or fractured, and the Dr. was fairly sure I'd live and in fact be feeling a lot better after the weekend. She was right, currently my issues are reduced range of motion and a build-up of fluid under the skin of my upper back calf. Ew! I expect the next few days will be spent on the couching hacking from home:</p>
