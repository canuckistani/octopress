E.D. Kain over at [Forbes](http://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2011/10/21/the-unsocial-network-why-google-is-wrong-to-kill-off-google-reader/) write a succinct piece on the utility of Google Reader:

<blockquote>Not in the sense that people in Reader are anti-social so much as the point is to harbor a small enclave of carefully selected people and create a safe-haven of sorts where that “carefully constructed human curated” list of shares and insights can flourish. In Reader, you don’t go after as many friends as possible. You certainly don’t see anyone from high school. Nobody shares photos of their kids. The discussions that do blossom are almost always very smart and focused. It’s the internet if the world were a more prefect place.</blockquote>

This neatly sums up my own ( very heavy ) use of Reader with a very short list of people who I use as filters for the wider world. We few merry nerds share constantly and are enriched by each other's subscriptions; we forget conveniently that all this time spent clicking and sharing further deepens Google's understanding of our online lives. Now they want to pull all that into Google+, which all of us are on but none of us actually use.

The thing is, we are probably smart enough to build our own, and I'm pretty sure we aren't alone. If I was going to re-do Reader as a project for my own particular purposes, it would be very simple:

* import opml
* bookmarklets or browser extensions to handle new subscriptions
* share and comment
* some sort of 'friend' discovery using twitter, which I choose because all of the people I share posts with on Reader, I also follow on twitter. In fact, this could just be a twitter list you create, assuming the twitter api provides access to those sorts of things.
* self-hosted. This doesn't need to be internet scale. In fact, it could be [unhosted](http://unhosted.org/), *and* an [Open Web App](https://apps.mozillalabs.com/).
