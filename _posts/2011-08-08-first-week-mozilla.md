title: First week @ Mozilla!
layout: post
---
As of today, I've been a Mozilla employee for almost 2 weeks! It's been a bit crazy, full of travel, burritos and fog. The first week in Mountain View was great; I met a ton of people, and I hope to be able to remember some of their names when I see them next at Mozilla's All Hands week in San Jose in September.

For the curious, a typical first week at Mozilla in Mountain View ( MV ) goes something like this:

* you show up on Monday, go straight to orientation, get your laptop, email hooked up, shown the wiki, etc. 
* at 11AM on Mondays there is an All Hands meeting broadcast on Air Mozilla where new hires and interns are introduced. You'll stand on the 'X' and squint into the bright light
* every Monday at 12 there is a free lunch. Yay! Free lunch!
* you'll probably get a tour around the MV offices, get assigned a seat, and spend a good couple of days reading wiki pages on all manner of things like:
    * IRC & Vidyo
    * benefits
    * Android phones
    * product plans related to your specific team
    * etc.

For the rest of the week you'll probably get introduced to people both on and off your own team who may act as resources or mentors for your new position. You'll likely get introduced in one or meetings that take place over live video feed with people meetings rooms and home offices spread across the world. Slowly but surely a picture will emerge of what your immediate and more long-term goals will be. By the end of the week you'll be tired and exhilarated, ready for some rest, and excited getting down to real work the next week.

My first week at Mozilla was a lot like this, except in reverse. Due to some scheduling issues, I actually showed up on a Wednesday and dove straight into a meeting with Dave Mason ( Product Manager for Jetpack ) where he filled me in on what my goals would be for the next few months. He then found me a desk ( on 2, near Gigo ), pointed me at enough wiki pages to get me started, and I was off. I had requested a Macbook Air but it was still on order, so I had my own 15" Macbook Pro to use.

I spent the first couple of days reading, meeting with people and troubleshooting account problems related to various systems Mozilla uses. The guys on the #desktop team helped me out on a few occasions and also hooked me up with my new laptop by the end of the second day! By Friday I was fully functional in terms of systems and communication and happily interacting with my new team members over email, Skype, video and IRC. By the time I got to orientation on Monday I was an old hat with Mozilla's systems. 

So it happened that my last day in Mountain View was a Monday instead of the usual first day; Myk introduced me at the weekly all hands meeting in 10 Forward, a tasty lunch was servers shortly afterwards, and I had a couple more meetings that afternoon before calling the car service to get me to my SFO-area hotel in preparation for flying home bright and early the next day.

While I was in California I also engaged in a project I like to call the #burritopocalypse. The one type of food that is not readily available in Vancouver is the mighty Mission Burrito, so when in California I like to indulge a bit. The goal for the week was to average 1 burrito per day, but I ended up skipping two days. Here they are:


*The mighty Steak & Prawn Super Burrito at <a href="http://is.gd/Km0MyT">La Corneta Tacqueria</a> in Burlingame:*
