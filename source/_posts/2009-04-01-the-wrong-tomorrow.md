<p>Maciej Ceg≈Çowski ( the erudite writer / painter / web hacker behind my favorite blog ever, '<a href="http://idlewords.com/">idle words</a>' ) made this cute site called 'The Wrong Tomorrow' where he posts predictions by pundits and tracks when, er, if they are wrong:</p>
<p><a href="http://wrongtomorrow.com/">http://wrongtomorrow.com/</a></p>
<p>Should be fun to track as time goes on; I note with some glee that <a href="http://scobleizer.com/">Scoble</a> is the first failure. Mind you, Scoble was hardle making predictions about economic recovery, was he?</p>
