title: Roger's 3G iPhone bundle 'Hotspot' access limitations
layout: post
---
<p><em>Some background: I am currently a Roger's customer, but am out of contract and ( being a mostly-enthusiastic Mac user ) have been looking forward to seeing a legit iPhone in Canada. Even though I signed the Ruined iPhone petition, I'm probably still going to get one this Friday, but more on that later.</em></p>
<p>This morning I spent about 35 minutes on hold listening to some of the worst muzak ever, waiting to get a clarification on one single question: is the 'Hotspot' access available at any 'Hotspot', or only ones implemented by Rogers/Fido? My fervent hope was the former, but knowing Rogers and reading the <a href="http://www.rogers.com/web/content/wireless-products/iphone_voice_data_packages">vague</a> <a href="http://your.rogers.com/business/wireless/plans_services/hotspot.asp?cm_mmc=grdrt-_-all-_-en-_-hotspots">wording</a> on their website I suspected the latter. It turns out I was right, the Rogers rep I spoke to had to ask his boss, but eventually came back and clarified that <span style="font-style: italic;">only Rogers or Fido-operated hotspots were included</span>.</p>
<p>Why is this distinction important? For Vancouverites, it is *<span style="font-style: italic;">very</span>* important. According the to the <a href="http://www.canadianhotspot.ca/">Hotspot website</a>, there are only 3 Rogers hotspots in all of metro Vancouver. If the access had included bell-operated hotspots as well, the coverage would instead extend to <a href="http://www.canadianhotspot.ca/advancedsearch.php?keywords=Vancouver&amp;cmd_search_x=0&amp;cmd_search_y=0&amp;page=all">all 119 hotpost locations listed on the website</a>, including what looks like half the Starbuck's in town.</p>
<p>Clearly if you're in the lower mainland, you might be better served rolling some sort of custom plan for your 3G iPhone instead of choosing this bundle; Rogers seems to think the hotspot access is a valuable part of the bundle, and if you were in Toronto this would be the case as there are far more Second Cup locations there.</p>
