I'm excited to head out to Toronto ( what my mother refers to fondly as '*the big smoke*' ) next week to give a talk on developing add-ons with the [Add-on SDK](http://fsoss.senecac.on.ca/2011/node/77) at Seneca College's Free Software and Oopen Source Symposium. Looking over the schedule of talks I am amazed at the diversity of talks; it is refreshing be able to attend a single event and attend sessions on such diverse subjects as:

* [Drupal theme building](http://fsoss.senecac.on.ca/2011/node/99)
* [XBMC](http://fsoss.senecac.on.ca/2011/node/58) - using Linux as a media centre.
* [OLPC Project work in Kenya](http://fsoss.senecac.on.ca/2011/node/107)
* [Raspberry Pi](http://fsoss.senecac.on.ca/2011/node/110) a full Linux system in a tiny $25 package. [DO WANT](http://www.raspberrypi.org/).
* [Lots of other amazing stuff](http://fsoss.senecac.on.ca/2011/schedule) - really, I'm just scratching the surface!

I am also pleased that Mozilla has a strong presence at FSOSS this year; not only are we sponsoring but there are talks on [Popcorn.js](http://fsoss.senecac.on.ca/2011/node/79) and [Mozilla release management](http://fsoss.senecac.on.ca/2011/node/108), and I am planning to organize a Mozilla BOF for Saturday afternoon.
