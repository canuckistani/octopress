If you have a Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 laying around the house ( and I suspect a large number of Mozillians do! ), you probably don't use it for much. The OS is dated and not well supported by most apps, and the performance is awful.

I just flashed mine with a newer Android 4-based ROM called AOPK ( Android Open Kang Project, dunno? ) that not only updates and simplifies the OS, but also allows you a lot of control over the performance.

Here's a peek at the desktop ( with some stuff moved around of course... )

Here's the meaty part, the custom ROM control lets you overclock the cpu as high as 1400MHZ!

I toyed with 1400 but things got sketchy. 1200MHZ seems to be the sweet spot, and between that and a slimmer, more modern Android version the 'ol Tab 10.1 actually feels pretty snappy? The important things work, from my point of view anyway: Netflix, Kindle, Elder Signs Omens, Hipmunk.

Some links if you want to look into this:

* [You'll need the latest version of Clockworkmod](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1090289)
* [AOKP Milestone 6 download](http://aokp.co/index.php/releases/_/milestone-6-r27)
* [This looks like a pretty good tutorial](http://theunlockr.com/2012/05/11/how-to-flash-clockworkmod-recovery-on-the-wifi-only-galaxy-tab-10-1/)

Also, I needed a windows install to use Odin to initially install the Clockworkmod recovery kernel. Once I got there, I switched to using File Expert to host an ftp server on the tablet in order to transfer files from my Mac, and CWM itself to make backups and flash ROMs. There are probably cooler ways to do this ( ROM Manager, etc )?
