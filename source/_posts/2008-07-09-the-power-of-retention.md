<p>I finally got around to calling Rogers and seeing what my options were for an iPhone plan. The call of course was largely spurred on by the jaw-dropping shocker news that Rogers was offering a 6GB data option for iphone bought this summer for $30/month:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"<a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20080709.wgtiphone0709/BNStory/Technology/home">Customers who purchase an iPhone and sign up for a three-year contract any time between July 11 – when the device goes on sale – and the end of August will be eligible for a $30-per-month data plan giving them access to 6-Gigabytes of data. Rogers previously had charged $100 for a 6-GB plan.</a>" ( from the Globe and Mail )</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, I've been a Rogers customer for a looong long time and as I may have mentioned earlier, do not currently have a contract of any kind with them. As well, my current voice plan is pretty darned cheap thanks in part to the hard-nosed negotiation skills of my fiancée. When I called Rogers I got on the line with a relatively pleasant rep who helped me put together the following package:</p>
<ul>
  <li>my existing voice plan stays the same, which includes 200 daytime minutes, free evenings and weekends starting at 6pm and Caller Id for $25/month. I'd forgotten it was so darn good!</li>

  <li>an added $30/month for the 6GB of data</li>

  <li>we removed my current 'value' pack which included voicemail, as visual voicemail is already included in the data package</li>

  <li>a free text messaging package of 150 messages/month as an extra bonus</li>

  <li>I qualify for a $50 rebate on the price of the phone ( I'm likely getting a 16GB black one. )</li>
</ul>
<p>The grand calculation looks like this:</p>
<pre>
(((25 + 30 + 6.95 + 0.50) * 1.12) * 36) + (299*1.12) - 50
</pre>
<p>= $2802.86 over the next three years, or $69/month after tax and tip. This isn't too bad, only $15-20/month more than I am paying right now with no data plan whatsoever ( and some weird bundle I never really use ). Now of course the real challenge is going to be finding a phone on Friday morning to buy.</p>
<p>My advice to people who are already Fido or Rogers customers ( who are <a href="http://bmannconsulting.com/blog/bmann/rogers-launch-iphone-canada-30-6gb-data-plan">more comfortable with contracts than Boris</a> ) is to call up and play a polite game of hardball to get retention plan features with this promotional data plan. It is <em>by far</em> the best advertised deal in Canada so far, and more than that, will likely be actually *useful* to me; I really wasn't looking forward to squeezing my data usage into 400mb.</p>
