<p>Today the Vision, COPE and Green municipal parties announced an agreement on <a href="http://www.francesbula.com/?p=218">co-operating with nomination votes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"(VANCOUVER) The COPE and Vision executives are announcing a tentative agreement for cooperation for the 2008 election. Both organizations feel that the agreement is an important step to create the kind of campaign that can return progressive government to city hall." ( <a href="http://www.francesbula.com">www.francesbula.com</a> )</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Considering the egos involved, I would hardly expect the Liberals, NDP and Greens to do something like this, even though the Greens and the Liberals already sort of are, much to other party's dismay. I *would* say to the brain trust over at the Federal NDP party that this sort of left-center co-operation is the *only* way you could ever help form a government in this country, and that it is also the Cons' second-worst nightmare.</p>
<p>Their worst nightmare? Probably electoral reform along the lines of <a href="http://www.bc-stv.ca/">BC's STV proposal</a>, which would doom them to a permanent 30-40% slice of the pie.</p>
