<p>My favoritist audio software company in the world is <a href="http://www.audiodamage.com/">Audio Damage</a>, and in just two more days they're releasing <a href="http://www.audiodamage.com/downloads/product.php?pid=ADF002">Rough Rider</a>, a free compressor plugin that I KNOW will be cool and occupying many computing cycles on my computers. I love these guys so much, I own almost everything they've ever done. =)</p>
