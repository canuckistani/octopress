title: Open Letter to BC NDP Candidates

<p>I just got a message on Facebook from <a href="http://www.raylam.ca/">Ray Lam</a>, the NDP candidate for Gregor's old seat in vancouver-Fairview. Ray seems like a nice guy, but my political views don't mesh well with the BC NDP party particularly well. I wrote this reply to him, and have decided to publish this as an open letter to any NDP candidate:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Hi Ray,</p>

  <p>My priorities are electoral reform, and I strongly support a Ward system in Vancouver as well as the BC STV proposal. Do you?<br /></p>

  <p>I'm not in your riding anymore ( we did back when Gregor ran, but then moved to Cedar Cottage / Trout lake ). I plan on voting for the Green Party Provincially and Federally for the foreseeable future, and Yes on STV. I am a member of Vision Vancouver as well.</p>

  <p>While I agree with some of the Social Justice aspects in the NDP's platform, I feel the party as it exists and/or is perceived today is simply too 1 dimensional for it to be an effective progressive political voice. I will say it's nice to see some candidates in the NDP that aren't just from some Union.<br /></p>

  <p>Don't get me wrong though, it's not like there is a lot of choice in BC currently in terms of party affiliation. I think above all that the 2-party system in BC is deeply dysfunctional and needs to be re-built from scratch. The NDP may suffer from this as much as the Liberals, but fairer representation for the voters in BC is worth far more to me than some dumb-ass party.<br /></p>

  <p>Hope you appreciate the rant for what it's worth =) and good luck with your campaign.<br /></p>

  <p>Jeff<br /></p>
