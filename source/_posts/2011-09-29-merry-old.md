So I'm in London. Yay!

I'm here ever-so-briefly with my [fellow](http://blog.mozilla.com/warner/) [SDK](http://autonome.wordpress.com/) [team](http://blog.techno-barje.fr/) [members](https://github.com/ZER0) presenting an evening of workshops at London City University. That's [happening tonight](http://jetpack-london-2011.eventbrite.com/), by the way!

Pro tip: if you're a nerd and you're looking for 3G access in the UK, do what we did yesterday and get the 1GB, 20 quid 3G data only SIM. Who are you going to call in the UK? Just get on Whatsapp or Groupme with your friends ( Gchat will do in a pinch ) and embrace the pure-data future. You ( well, *I* ) are going to want GMaps far more than a working phone.

Dietrich and I did some exploring yesterday afternoon around the Clerkenwell / Islington area and I was struck not just by the history implied by some of the architecture, but also how very obviously ancient things are situated directly next to very modern things.

Later we met up with my dear Londonite friends [Dave](http://twitter.com/#!/QZebrowski) and [Jen](http://twitter.com/#!/JenRodvold), drank [real ale](http://www.meantimebrewing.com/our-beers/meantime-london-pale-ale) and sampled [rare whisky](http://www.flickr.com/photos/anisotropic/6194790644/sizes/m/in/photostream/) before finally turning in. I slept like the dead.
