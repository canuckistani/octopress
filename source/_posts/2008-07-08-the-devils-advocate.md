<p>Continuing on with this week's impromptu blog revival and series of posts about why I'm going to get a 3G iPhone this week, I thought I'd take a closer look at the alternatives to my potentially foolish decision to run squealing like a little fat kid after an ice cream truck on the hottest day of the year into the arms of not just Steve Jobs, but Ted Rogers as well.</p>
<p>So what other options are there? Let's look.</p>
<p>1. "<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYAAbbuEpnw">You've got the touch!</a>"</p>
<p>If you absolutely have to have a little black touch-screen Apple doo-dad but don't want the 3 year 'high-value' Rogers contract, you could always just buy an iTouch, get a cheap phone on a voice-only 2-year contract, and call it a day.</p>
<p>2. "<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFukxa_ZEhg">You've got the touch!</a>" pt 2</p>
<p>You could also go get an HTC Touch on a 2 year plan form Bell or Telus, pay a slightly cheaper plan that does include some wap/email data, and still be contract free <a href="http://ca.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idCAN0826829620080708">just in time for all of those spectrum auction winners</a> to start flogging 3G WCDMA/HSDPA phones. Me, I'm kind of allergic to Windows so I'll skip that.</p>
<p>3. "<a href="http://lucydotd.com/index.php?page=38">Recycling is the new Jesus</a>"</p>
<p>You could also pick up a 2G iPhone on <a href="http://cgi.ebay.ca/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;&amp;item=280243848646">ebay</a> or <a href="http://vancouver.en.craigslist.ca/ele/746624271.html">craigslist</a> for a few hundred, then smugly negotiate some sort of data plan with Rogers or more likely Fido outside of a contract, secure in the knowledge that you could walk away at any moment! Maybe you'll miss the GPS, who knows?</p>
