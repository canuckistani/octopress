So I have chips missing from the edge near the mouse pad, and as I have AppleCare coverage I can get this fixed for free. I took it into <a href="http://www.macstation.com/">Mac Station</a> and they said the following:

<ul><li>they need my macBook to order the part, because</li>
<li>they need to order the part from Apple</li>
<li>the part usually comes in within 24 hours or less, *and*</li>
<li>they MUST ship the old part back to Apple within 24 hours of receiving the new part or ( get this ) they would not be able to re-order the same part for the same laptop again for 90 days.</li></ul>

Apparently this is a new thing, specific to more recent MacBook models like mine.

So I talked them into ordering the part on Thurs, dropped off the laptop Friday morning, and then was told Friday afternoon that the part was stuck in customs and they would have it all done by Monday. 

I usually get great service from mac Station and I don't necessarily think of this as *bad* service given the constraints. I do think it is completely absurd of Apple to place these kinds of contraints on a service depot. Who cares if it is 24 hours or 72 hours? All I want to be able to do is drop my laptop off and pick it up the same day, especially for a job that takes ( apparently ) less than 15 minutes to do.
