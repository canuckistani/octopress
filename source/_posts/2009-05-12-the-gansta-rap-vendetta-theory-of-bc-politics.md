<p>I can't help but equate the dichotomy of Big Biz Liberals vs. Big Union NDP pinkos as a kind of gang turf warfare. You know, like Biggy vs. Tupac or something.</p>
<p>Here's a fact about BC, or any other Province in Canada: massive amounts of Gov't revenue goes to pay unionized Gov't employees. This means you have one of two scenarios when a Public Employees Union goes to negotiate a contract:</p>
<ol>
  <li>the current Gov't is largely supported by large corporations looking for tax reductions that can only be reduced by cutting costs, and whose chief political opponents' revenues are funded by the Union dues from members of the Unions.</li>

  <li>the current Gov't is largely supported by the Union dues from members of the Unions.<br /></li>
</ol>
<p>In my mind, either scenario is an un-resolvable conflict of interest, but legally there is nothing actually wrong with any of it. My <em>personal</em> opinion is that this particular dichotomy has been retarding BC politics for 50-60 years. I don't think anything will change until one side or the other frees itself from fiscal reliance on either the Unions or the Corporations that seeks to diminish them.</p>
<p><em>I think what we need is a 21st century political force that fund-raises directly from its supporters, and is interested in more broadly inspiring voters than either the Liberals or the NDP seem capable.</em></p>
