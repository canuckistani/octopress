I've been picking away at this project for the better part of the week, mostly while watching playoffs hockey. Well, the Canucks lost tonight so I might as well release some code!

[Komodo extension page](http://community.activestate.com/node/6797)

[Github repo](https://github.com/canuckistani/Jetpack-for-Komodo)

This extension integrates the basic SDK commands of init, test, run and docs  and represents a minimum viable integration. It's mentioned in the Github README. The official 1.0 release of the SDK is coming up next week so it seems at least somewhat timely. ;)
