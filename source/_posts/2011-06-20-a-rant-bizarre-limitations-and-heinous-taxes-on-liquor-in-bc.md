Couldn't help but link to [this](http://goo.gl/FmpsX):

<blockquote>We have excessively high taxes on liquor which result in prices being about double what they should be. For example, Chateau Ste. Michelle Riesling, a Washington state wine, is commonly available for $6 south of the border. It is $15.99 in BC because the standard LDB markup on wine is 123% plus 12% HST on top of that for a grand total of 135% tax.</blockquote>

I'm quite sure these insane taxation levels are the reason why all my [favourite NW microbrews](http://goo.gl/EPlfg) are so incredibly expensive at [Brewery Creek](http://brewerycreekliquorstore.com/) and [St. Augustines](http://goo.gl/dP8nS).
