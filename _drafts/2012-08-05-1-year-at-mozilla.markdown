*Aside, I've been thinking of doing one of these posts and really liked [Jared's post](http://msujaws.wordpress.com/2012/06/05/my-one-year-anniversary-at-mozilla/) a couple of months ago on his first year. Jared's post has also been keeping me from writing this post as well - his accomplishments and personal impact on Firefox have been huge, so it has been daunting to post about my own.*

A little over a year ago, I started working for Mozilla as a developer evangelist with the Jetpack team. As I write this, I've just gotten back from a 2-week trip to Brazil helping with Mozilla's presence at FISL and representing Mozilla with my colleagues Shez and Christian at various meetings, events and meetups all concerned with the Q1 2013 launch of FirefoxOS on a mobile phone in Brazil, a project that was barely a twinkle in Andreas Gal's eye last year at this time.

So what have I been up to? Sitting here recovering from 20 hours of flights, my glib answer might be "I can't remember...". Maybe a better way to break it down is by topic?

###Events

If you're a Mozillian, you know there is always some travel involved. I just looked at my frequent flyer account and realized I've clocked something like 70,000 miles in the last 12 months. The lion's share of this travel was so that I could speak at or attend various developer events, including:

* Jetpack workshops in London
* JSConf EU
* FSOSS 2012
* MozCamp EU
* FOSDEM
* MDN Hackdays in NYC & Porto Alegre, Brazil
* FISL 13

But a list doesn't really tell the whole tale. Colleagues of mine do over 50 events a year, and practically live out of airport lounges and hotel rooms. My role(s) working with both Jetpack and developer engagement teams also included a lot of project co-ordination, blogging, tweeting, online community support and events planning.
