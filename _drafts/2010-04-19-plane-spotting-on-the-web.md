<p>I'm eagerly awaiting the arrival of my newly minted, custom-ordered MacBook Pro. The thing's been built in China and scanned by UPS, but little other info is available to me. My, er, obsessive tendencies of course led me to investigate the possible arrival path of the new machine in frightening detail, as can only be had on the web. For your perusal:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://is.gd/bAdOC">a thread on Macrumors</a> filled with people all sharing info about MBPro shipping details.</li>

  <li>a <a href="http://is.gd/bAdPo">nice compilation of info</a> for the curious by a forum member.</li>

  <li>the completely, nerdishly awesome <a href="http://flightaware.com/">flightaware.com</a>, which tracks every flight they can, in nearly real time.</li>

  <li>quite possible <a href="http://flightaware.com/live/flight/UPS81/history/20100420/0009Z/PANC/KSDF">the flight ( or at least route )</a> my new laptop is on.</li>
</ul><br />
